# Enterprise MCP Server Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in our enterprise environment. MCP servers enhance developer productivity by providing contextual information directly within VSCode alongside GitHub Copilot.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely access external data sources and tools. In our enterprise context, MCP servers run locally on developer machines and provide read-only access to internal systems.

## Enterprise Architecture

```
Developer Machine
├── VSCode + GitHub Copilot
├── Local MCP Servers
│   ├── Database MCP (Oracle, Snowflake, Postgres)
│   ├── Internal GitHub MCP
│   ├── SharePoint MCP
│   ├── Backstage.io MCP
│   ├── Jira MCP
│   ├── Figma MCP
│   ├── ServiceNow MCP
│   └── Internal API MCP
└── Corporate Network Access
```

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Code Context**: Access internal documentation, APIs, and databases directly in your development environment
- **Improved Productivity**: Reduce context switching between tools
- **Enterprise Security**: All servers run locally with existing authentication
- **Read-Only Access**: Database servers are configured for read-only operations
- **GitHub Copilot Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Copilot workflows
